# C++ Projects - Object-Oriented Programming Journey

Welcome to my C++ learning repository! This project is dedicated to mastering Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts using C++.

## 📚 About

This repository contains a series of C++ modules (CPP00 through CPP05) that progressively explore fundamental and advanced OOP concepts. Each module includes multiple exercises designed to build a solid understanding of C++ programming principles.

```

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

Throughout these modules, I'm learning and practicing:

- **Basic C++ Syntax**: Understanding fundamental C++ constructs
- **Classes and Objects**: Implementing OOP principles
- **Memory Management**: Working with dynamic memory allocation
- **References and Pointers**: Understanding memory addressing
- **Operator Overloading**: Customizing operators for classes
- **Inheritance**: Creating hierarchical class structures
- **Polymorphism**: Both compile-time and runtime polymorphism
- **Abstract Classes and Interfaces**: Designing flexible architectures
- **Exception Handling**: Writing robust error-handling code

## 🛠️ Technologies

- **Language**: C++ (96.9%)
- **Build System**: Makefile (3.1%)
- **Compiler**: C++ compiler with C++98 standard (or higher)

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (g++, clang++, etc.)
- Make utility

### Building and Running
Each module contains exercises with their own Makefiles. To compile and run an exercise:

```bash
# Navigate to the desired module and exercise
cd CPP00/ex00

# Build the project
make

# Run the executable
./[executable_name]

# Clean build files
make clean    # Remove object files
make fclean   # Remove object files and executable
make re       # Rebuild from scratch
```

## 📖 Module Overview

### CPP00 - Introduction to C++
Introduction to C++ basics, namespaces, classes, member functions, and I/O streams.
### CPP01 - Memory Allocation
Deep dive into memory allocation, pointers to members, references, and the switch statement.

### CPP02 - Ad-hoc Polymorphism
Understanding fixed-point numbers, operator overloading, and orthodox canonical class form.

### CPP03 - Inheritance
Exploring inheritance hierarchies and the diamond problem.

### CPP04 - Subtype Polymorphism
Working with abstract classes, interfaces, and runtime polymorphism.

### CPP05 - Exceptions
Mastering exception handling and repetition of previous concepts.

## 📝 Notes

- All code follows C++98 standard (unless specified otherwise)
- Each exercise builds upon concepts from previous modules
- Makefiles include flags for strict compilation (-Wall -Wextra -Werror)
